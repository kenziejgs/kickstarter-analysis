# An Analysis of Kickstarter Campaigns
Analyzing the outcomes of various kickstarters with a focus on theater kickstarters
---
## Overview of Project
This project utilized a dataset detailing the outcomes, initial dates, final dates, number of backers, and total pledged (among other variables) for a wide variety of Kickstarter campaigns. From within this dataset the client was primarily focused on the outcomes for Kickstarter campaigns in the theater world, specifically plays. In order to guide the client to a successful launch of their potential Kickstarter campaign, I wanted to demonstrate the outcome of various theater Kickstarters based upon their start date as well as their initial goal.

## Analysis and Challenges
#### Theater Outcomes by Launch Date
###### Analysis
In order to best guide the client towards the optimal launch date for their potential Kickstarter campaign, I examined the data for any trends on outcome based upon launch dates. After converting the original launch dates from Unix format to readable dates, it became much easier to work with our data.
